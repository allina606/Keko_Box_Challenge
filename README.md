## Keko Box Challenge

Build a web page.
This webpage should have a text input on the left side where I can enter a word. On the right half of the screen there should be three boxes. In the first box I'll see the word I entered backwards, in the second box I'll see the word I entered in all caps, and in the third box that same word in a larger font. I should be able to edit the word on the left half of the screen and see the words on the right half change without pressing any buttons.

In the project directory, you can run:
### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
